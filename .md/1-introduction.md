# Introduction

The latest generation of the Mixed Reality Toolkit, also known as MRTK3, is an open-source, Microsoft-driven project that provides components and features used to accelerate cross-platform, mixed reality app development in Unity. MRTK3 is currently available as a public preview.

MRTK3 supports a variety of features such as a cross-platform input system, building blocks for spatial interactions, and an intuitive system for building UI elements. MRTK3's support for in-editor simulation also facilitates faster iterations. Built on top of OpenXR, MRTK3 supports a wide range of devices available now and in the future.

MRTK3 includes several key improvements over previous versions of MRTK, as outlined below:

### **Architecture**

The MRTK3 architecture is built on the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit and the Unity Input System. The platform is OpenXR-focused with flexible interaction paradigms.

### **Performance**

MRTK3 rewrote a wide range of features to boost performance. As a result, users can expect lower barriers to performant applications on the HoloLens 2 and other mixed reality headsets when building with MRTK3.

### **User interface**

MRTK3 has introduced new interaction models with an updated mixed reality design language. It includes dynamic auto-layout UI, unified 2D & 3D input support, and increased accessibility support. Data binding for branding, theming, dynamic data, and complex lists are now also included in MRTK3.

### **Accessibility**

MRTK3 features low vision aids and input assistance to facilitate the creation of applications that are accessible and inclusive.

Throughout this workshop, you'll learn about the core offerings of MRTK3 by creating a virtual showroom that includes some of the most exciting components this toolkit offers.
