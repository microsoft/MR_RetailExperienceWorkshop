# Configure Your Virtual Showroom With Interactivity

1. The instructions below demonstrate how to add the ability to manipulate certain objects in your scene with your hands (or controllers on VR devices.) This will allow you to move, rotate, and scale these objects, depending on the types of manipulations you set on those objects. Many of the objects will already be set up for you, but the steps below will walk you through setting up a few of your own. 

    - In the hierarchy window, navigate to **Retail Dress Showroom** > **Dress_FBX**, select the GameObject called **Hoodie_Optimized (3)**. Now in the inspector window click the **Add Component** button, then search for and select the **ObjectManipulator** script.

    - The **Object Manipulator** script makes an object movable, scalable, and rotatable using one or two hands. When you add the Object Manipulator script, the **Constraint Manager** script is automatically added as well because the Object Manipulator script depends on it.

        ![A screenshot of adding object manipulator.](img/add-object-manupilator.png)

    - Expand the **Object Manipulator** script. Under **ObjectManipulator Settings**, next to where it says **Allowed Manipulations**, click on the dropdown menu and make sure that **Scale** is **unchecked**. Do this by clicking on **Scale** and then check that it is disabled by opening the menu again. The checkmark should no longer be beside "Scale".

        ![A screenshot of disabling Scale](img/disable-scale-on-hanging-items.png)

        >**Note:** In this project, scaling should be disabled on all hanging objects.

    - Next, follow the same procedure to add the **Box Collider** component.

        ![A screenshot of adding box collider.](img/add-box-collider.png)

        >**Note:** If you're testing the app directly in the editor, it may be easier to perform mouse-based interactions. Mouse-based interactions enable you to use your mouse to select objects in the scenes for a 2D experience. Add the **UGUI Input Adapater Draggable** component to the **Hoody_Optimized (3)** object to enable mouse-based interactions.

2. In the hierarchy window, expand **Retail Dress Showroom** > **Table**. Then, select the GameObject named **Shirt (1)** to add the **Bounds Control** Script to make the GameObject "Scalable". With the game object still selected in the **Hierarchy** window, click on the **Add Component** button and select **Bounds Control**.

    ![A screenshot of adding bounds control](img/bounds-control.png)

3. Now, add a visual prefab for the bounds. In the inspector window, for the **Bounds Control** component, select the radio button next to the **Bounds Visuals Prefab**. Search for the **BoundingBoxwithHandles** prefab within the **Assest** tab. You may need to click the eye icon to unhide packages.

4. If not already completed, add the **Box Collider** component for the **Shirt (1)**.

5. Also, add the **Min Max Scale Constraint** Script to the GameObject. This is a convenient component to constrain scaling to a minimum and maximum size that is customizable.

    ![A screenshot of adding min max scale contsraint](img/min-max-scale-contsraint.png)

6. Expand the **Min Max Scale Constraint** component. Select the drop-down menu next to **Hand Type**, and disable **One-Handed** by clicking on it. To check if it's disabled, open the menu again and check to see that the checkmark next to it has disappeared. We do this so that an object cannot be scaled using only one hand.

    ![Screenshot of configuring the Min Max Scale Constraint component](img/configure-min-max-scale-constraint.png)

    >**Note:** Objects that will be scalable should all have a Min Max Sale Constraint component that is configured for Two handed scaling. This way the user doesn't accidentally scale an object while  simply trying to move it.

    >**Note:** If you're testing the app directly in the editor, it may be easier to perform mouse-based interactions. Mouse-based interactions enable you to use your mouse to select objects in the scenes for a 2D experience. Add the **UGUI Input Adapater Draggable** component to the **Shirt (1)** object to enable mouse-based interactions.

## Include UX elements

Here we plan to integrate the product details into a **UX Slate** and display it along with the product. This will provide an intuitive way for users to learn more about the products in our virtual showroom.

1. In the **Project window**, navigate to the **Assets** > **MR_RetailShowroom** > **Prefabs** folder, click-and-drag the **Cloth Tag** prefab onto the **Hoodie_Optimized (3)** Gameobject we worked with previously.

    - Drag and drop the **Cloth tag** onto the **Hoodie_Optimzed (3)** GameObject to make it, its **child** as shown below.

        ![A screenshot of dragging and dropping the UI tag.](img/add-cloth-tag.png)

    - You may be prompted to install TMP(TextMeshPro) in a pop-up window. Make sure to click Import TMP Essentials and close the pop-up window.

        ![A screenshot of importing TextMeshPro.](img/import-tmp.png)

2. Adjust the transform component of the UI tag to place it near the product (Hoodie_Optimzed (3)). Modify the following properties:

    - **Transform Position**: -0.42, 0.51, 2.89
    - **Rotation**: 1, 90, 90

3. We would like to have the UI tag appear when the user is interacting with the product and hidden when the user is not interacting with the product. To automatically activate and deactivate the tags, follow the instructions below.  

    - In the **Inspector window** of the **Hoodie_Optimzed (3)** GameObject, expand the **Object Manipulator** script to configure the **Manipulation Started** event by clicking on the + icon to add new event.

    - Drag and drop the child **Cloth UI Tag** to the empty field as shown in the figure below.

    - From the dropdown list that says **No Function**, select **GameObject** > **SetActive (bool)** to set this function as the action to be run when the event is triggered. Ensure that the argument checkbox is **checked**.

        ![A screenshot of configuring the manipulation started.](img/manupilation-started.png)

    - Follow the same procedure for the **Manipulation Ended** event. Ensure that the argument checkbox is **unchecked**.

        ![A screenshot of configuring the manipulation ended](img/manupilation-ended.png)

     -  Select the **Cloth tag** in hierarchy. In the **Inspector** window, ensure the Cloth tag is **unchecked** as shown in the image below. This makes the tag inactive by default, so that it is not seen before a user's interaction.

        ![A screenshot of unchecking the cloth tag](img/uncheck-cloth-tag.png)

4. To reposition the product to its original position after interactions, click on the Hoodie_Optimzed (3) GameObject and in the Inspector window, select the **Add Component** button and add the **Reposition Object** script.  

    - In the Inspector window, go to the **Object Manipulator** componentâ€™s **Manipulation Ended** event and press the (+) button to add an additional event.  

    - Drag and drop the Hoodie_Optimzed (3) prefab into the empty object field.

    - From the **No Function** dropdown list, and select **RepositionObject** > **ProductLeft()** as shown in the image below.

        ![A screenshot of adding the reposition](img/add-reposition.png)

## Using Solvers

Wouldn't it be convenient if the UI Tags followed you around, rather than being pinned in place? Follow the instructions below to attach a solver to the UI cards in order to have them naturally follow you.  

1. In the **Hierarchy** window, select the Cloth UI Tag under the **Hoodie_Optimized (3)** GameObject. Then, in **Inspector**, use **Add Component** to add the **Solver Handler** (Script) component. Configure the component as follows:

    - Verify that the Solver Handler component's Tracked Target Type is set to **Head**.

    - Verify that the Update Solvers checkbox is **checked**.

    - Add a **Box Collider** to the Cloth tag GameObject.

        ![A screenshot of configuring solver handler script](img/add-solver.png)

2. With the Cloth UI Tag still selected, use the **Add Component** button in the **Inspector** window to add the **Follow** (Script). Configure the component in the following ways.
    - Uncheck **Maintain Scale On Initialization**.
    - Change **Orientation Type** to **Face Tracked Object**.
    - Uncheck **Reorient When Outside Parameters**.
    - Change **Min Distance** to **1**. 
    - Change **Max Distance** to **3**.
    - Change **Default Distance** to **2**.
    - Check **Ignore Distance Clamp**
    >**Note:** All other values should stay the same. Feel free to double check against the image below.
